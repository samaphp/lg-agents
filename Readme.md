# Fork Modifications

## Changes from Original

- Disabled BarGPT private agent to remove private dependencies
- Modified Groq LLM to use lazy loading for better performance
- Added poetry.lock for reproducible dependency management
- Configured to work with OpenAI API only for testing
- Add CORS middleware for cross-origin requests

## Installation Steps

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key (set as `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samaphp/lg-agents.git
   cd lg-agents
   ```

2. Install dependencies using one of these methods:
   ```bash
   # Using pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # OR using Poetry
   poetry install
   ```

3. Run the service:
   ```bash
   uv run src/run_service.py
   ```
   > **Note:** If you encounter timeout errors, retry the command several times as the initial setup may require multiple attempts to bypass the default 30-second timeout.

# Sample AI Agent using LangGraph and CrewAI

This work is originallybased on [this repo](https://github.com/JoshuaC215/agent-service-toolkit) which was created by [JoshuaC215](https://github.com/JoshuaC215).  Thanks! 

This also uses the great product [Browser Use](https://browseruse.com/) to browse the web.

## Follow Along

Follow along as I post about program on my [websites](https://www.apsquared.co/posts/full-stack-ai-agents), [X account](https://x.com/APSquaredDev) and my Bluesky account [@apsquared](https://bsky.app/profile/apsquared.bsky.social).

Disclaimer: I'm not an expert at Python or LangGraph, just a developer trying to play with AI Agents and hoping to help others.

## Motivation

I wanted to create a simple AI agent that uses LangGraph and Browser Use and can be easily deployed as a full stack application.
I've also been playing with [CrewAI](https://crewai.com/) and wanted to see how to integrate it with LangGraph.

## Overview Diagram

![Overview Diagram](https://apsquared.co/agent_arch.png)

Built with [DiagramGPT](https://www.eraser.io/diagramgpt)

## Client

Part of what I wanted to do is to demonstrate a totally disconnected client that can be used to interact with the agent.  
On our website we have a set of agents that demonstrate a [full stack solution with a NextJS application](https://www.apsquared.co/tools).  You can also see the [code for the client here](https://github.com/apsquared/ap2-agents).

## Try Out the Sample Agents 

### Marketing Agent

The very simple marketing agent can be found [to try on Apquared.co](https://www.apsquared.co/tools/saas-marketing-agent) and helps businesses build a marketing plan based on their website.

### College Finder Agent

The college finder agent can be found [to try on Apquared.co](https://www.apsquared.co/tools/college-finder-agent)

### College Baseball Roster Agent

The [college baseball roster agent](https://www.apsquared.co/tools/team-roster-agent) finds the rosters of a college baseball and analyzes the stats about the players to help prospective players see if they are a fit.

### Vacation House Agent

The [vacation house agent](https://www.apsquared.co/tools/vacation-house-agent) helps find vacation houses based on the user's query.
This agent uses the [crewai](https://crewai.com/) framework to create the agent.

## Settings

Updates settings .in .env and settings.py file (in core)

## Commands

`uv run src/run_service.py` - run as a service

`uv run src/run_agent.py` - run as a single agent

`uv run src/run_agent_stream.py` - run as a single agent with streaming

## Adding new Agents

To add a new agent to the system, follow these steps:

1. Create a new folder in src/agents/
   - Define the agent using LangGraph/LangChain patterns in <agent_name>_agent.py
   - Add type hints and docstrings
   - Create a schema file in the directory <agent_name>_schema.py for agent specific schemas
   - Return the agent object

2. Register the agent in the AGENTS dictionary in `src/agents/agents.py`:
   ```python
   AGENTS = {
       "existing_agent": existing_agent_function,
       "your_new_agent": your_new_agent_function
   }
   ```

3. (Optional) Add any new tools needed by your agent in `src/tools/`:
   - Create new tool functions
   - Add tool configurations
   - Import and include tools in your agent definition

4. (Optional) Add new environment variables in `.env` if required by your agent

5. Update the run_agent.py to specify the new agent and its input:
   ```bash
   uv run src/run_agent.py
   ```
